  <h1><u>My pet Komodo dragon</u></h1>

  <p>People have asked me all the time why I decided to get Gary and I always give them the same answer. "Why not?"</p>
  <p>Reaching 3 meters in length and more than 135 kilograms, Komodo dragons are the largest lizards on Earth! It's a really great conversation starter and they scare
  away irritating people so win win. And plus we get along so well. We're both big cold blooded lizards he's basiclly my spirit animal.</p>
